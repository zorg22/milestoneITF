                                As a web developer at Evil Corp, I was a member of a team that constructed the best
                                page ever.

                                was responsible for both front and back end development.
                                We used a collection of technologies. There, my knowledge of C#, HTML, CSS and
                                JavaScript
                                expanded,
                                while I gained experience using some of the best, modern front-end frameworks
                                such as Bootstrap and React; MSSQL databases; Cassandra; Node.js; NPM; Gulp and Grunt;

                                paired programming, and Agile. As a member of this team, I also gained some experience
